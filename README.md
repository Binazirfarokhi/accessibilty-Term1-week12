“Accessibility in web design is like building a ramp next to the stairs — it helps everyone access the same place, just in different ways.”
Know someone who wears glasses or has dyslexia?
Have you ever used your phone in bright sunlight and struggled to see the screen?

____________
Semantic HTML	:
Use correct tags like <nav>, <main>, <section> instead of <div> for everything. Helps screen readers.	

Alternative Text (Alt Text)	Add alt="" to images so screen readers can describe them to blind users.	Use an image with good and bad alt text, show how screen readers read them.

Keyboard Navigation	Make sure you can tab through buttons and links.	

Color Contrast	Ensure text is readable even for color-blind users.	Use  contrast-ratio.com on real examples.

Responsive Design for Mobile	Ensure zooming, readable text, and accessible touch targets on small screens.	Use DevTools to show mobile view. Demonstrate how small buttons are hard to tap.
____Tips for accessibility : 
Use viewport meta tag properly.

Make sure buttons and links are large enough (48x48px recommended).

Use accessible form labels and inputs (<label for="name">Name</label>).

Avoid hover-only interactions — mobile users can’t hover!

6. Use Descriptive Links
Avoid: <a href="#">Click here</a>
Better: <a href="/apply">Apply for the program</a>
Why: Screen reader users often navigate by links only — unclear links confuse them.
